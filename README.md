# autonomous-normative-rulemaking
Formal, proof-driven framework for autonomous normative decision-making. The work derives falsifiable conditions of normative admissibility from empirical constraints on agent viability and causal threat structure, establishing SVD, Threat Index, and the SVD–minimax principle as a closed normative logic.
