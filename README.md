# Formal Conditions for Autonomous Normative Rule-Making

This repository presents a research preprint that develops a formal,
proof-driven framework for autonomous normative decision-making.

The work addresses a foundational question:

Can an autonomous system perform lawmaking if it lacks internally defined,
falsifiable conditions under which a legal rule becomes normatively inadmissible?

The paper argues that autonomous lawmaking is possible only if normative
admissibility is determined by empirically observable consequences of regulation
and if conditions of normative rejection are specified within the system’s
internal logic.

## Core idea

The framework derives a closed normative logic from empirical constraints on
agent viability and the causal structure of threats, rather than from normative
axioms, interpretive judgment, or external evaluation procedures.

Regulatory intervention is modeled as a transformation of the space of viable
action trajectories available to agents over time.

## Main results

- The **Space of Viable Dynamics (SVD)** is derived as the unique value functional
  representing agents’ normative interests.
- The **Threat Index (TI)** is established as the uniquely admissible quantitative
  measure of regulatory impact on SVD, accounting for probability, magnitude,
  causal structure, and irreversibility of harm.
- The **SVD–minimax principle** is proven to be the only rationally and
  dynamically stable rule for autonomous regulatory choice under interdependent
  behavior and uncertainty.

Together, these elements constitute a falsifiable normative logic suitable for
autonomous regulation.

## Empirical validation

The formal framework is examined through controlled test scenarios in which the
system generates regulatory outcomes without access to existing statutes,
jurisdictions, or precedents. The experiments confirm reproducibility, stability,
and invariance of normative outcomes under equivalent empirical conditions.

## Scope and limitations

The framework applies to regulatory domains in which causal effects on agent
viability can be formally described and empirically evaluated. The paper does
not propose a concrete legal system or jurisdiction-specific implementation.
Algorithmic and architectural details of tested implementations are treated as
technical know-how and are not disclosed.
